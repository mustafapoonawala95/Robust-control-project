# Robust-control-project
This is a course project for EML6934 (Robust control-Aero) offered at the department of Mechanical and Aerospace engineering at University of Florida in Fall 2020 
For any questions please contact me at mustafapoonawala@ufl.edu

## SUMMARY
In this project an output feedback system to track the vertical acceleration of a medium range air-to-air missile (MRAAM) is
designed and used in a True proportional navigation guidance law to intercept a target drone
with minimum miss distance. The missileâ€™s short period dynamics are used for this purpose.
Robust servomechanism theory and Luenberger observer design is used in the design. The
project is divided in 2 parts, namely A and B. Part A consists of designing the closed loop
system with the design requirements mentioned, using full state feedback first, and then using
output feedback with Acceleration and pitch rate as the outputs
